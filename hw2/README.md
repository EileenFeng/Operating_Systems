### Operating Systems HW2
### Yazhe(Eileen) Feng

- How to compile
  - Type in 'make all' to compile all programs

- How to run
  - Type in './threads' to run the first program (first part of homework)
  - Type in './mysh' to run the simple shell

- Limitations
  - Do not allow special symbols such as '&'
  - Spaces need to be inserted between each two arguments
  - Does not support 'cat' with redirection
  - Does not support multiple commands input in one line, for instance 'pwd ls' does not work, a system error will be given but the program ./mysh mostly does not crash
