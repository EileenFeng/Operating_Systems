## CS355 Operating Systems HW01
### Name: Yazhe(Eileen) Feng

### How to compile the program
- This project contains three files. 'hw1a.c' for part 1a, 'hw1b.c' for part 1b, and 'microcat.c' for part 2 and extra creid.
- To compile the program, type 'make'; to compile specific program, type 'make <executable>' (for instance 'make hw1a')


### How to run the program
- part 1a: type in './hw1a' to run the program
- part 1b: type in './hw1b -s <seconds>' to custom the interval. The interval can only be integers; if a number that is not an integer is typed in, the program will default the interval to 1 second. If instead of the '-s' flag, another flag is typed in, the program will exit since there is an invalid input
